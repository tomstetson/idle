## How does it work?

On your computer, run `Idle` instead of `claude` or `Idle codex` instead of `codex` to start your AI through our wrapper. When you want to control your coding agent from your phone, it restarts the session in remote mode. To switch back to your computer, just press any key on your keyboard.

## 🏠 Who We Are

We're engineers scattered across Bay Area coffee shops and hacker houses, constantly checking how our AI coding agents are progressing on our pet projects during lunch breaks. Idle Coder was born from the frustration of not being able to peek at our AI coding tools building our side hustles while we're away from our keyboards. We believe the best tools come from scratching your own itch and sharing with the community.
